# Analog instrumentation arduino shield

Industrial analog instrumentation signalling arduino shield.

The primary purpose of this shield is to interface the Arduino with typical analog signals used in industrial environments, and to allow for easy experimentation and learning. It is not intended to be used in production environment. Although the circuit likely could work reliably in such environments, it has not been tested with that in mind.

Features:

* I2C communication with the Arduino (or another microcontroller of your choice)
* 2x 4 - 20 mA output
* 2x 4 - 20 mA input
* 24 V DC power output

## Voltage to current conversion

In order to convert a voltage to a current one option is to use the Howland Current Converter.



## Current to voltage conversion



## SEPIC converter for 5 V to 24 V



## Driver API
